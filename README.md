# s21matrix+
A project for [School 21](https://21-school.ru/) (a former campus of [42](https://42.fr/en/homepage/)). The task was to implement a basic class for storing a matrix, plus certain matrix operations. This is my first C++ project.

*I didn't get to choose the naming, whether it should've been a class in the first place, etc, etc.*

**What I've learned**
- How C++ is different from C
- Classes in C++, object lifetimes, move/copy semantics
- Basic containers from `std` (though I didn't use them here)
- Exceptions in C++
- The basics of [GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest)
